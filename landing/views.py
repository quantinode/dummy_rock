    ),
    (
        "How do students join a classroom?",
        "Teachers share an 8-character join code (e.g. AILAB8C3) via WhatsApp or on the board. Students visit the join URL on any browser — no app download needed."

    (
        "Which boards / curricula does AI Lab follow?",

    ),
    (
        "Do students need any prior coding knowledge?",
        "No. Class 8–10 tracks start from absolute basics (logic gates, patterns, sorting). Coding concepts are introduced gradually. Class 11–12 tracks go into practical AI implementation."
    ),
    (
        "How is progress tracked?",
